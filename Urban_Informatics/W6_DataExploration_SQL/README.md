# Data Exploration and SQL 

### Assignment 1: Manhattan vs Brooklyn data exploration
This was a basic data exploration exercise using NYC PLUTO (Property Land Use Tax Lot Output) data. In it I examine what buildings are more prominent in each borough.
### Assignment 2: citiBike exploration using SQL
This utilizes a postgresql database (carto) to find the following
* number of trips per station
* average/max/min trip durations
* selecting trips only on weeekends/weekdays
* selecting station with longest average trip duration during weekends and within 500m of Times Square.
