# Citi Bike Data Visualization

## Assignment 1: Locals vs. Tourists
![Alt text](Locals_vs_Tourists_Start_time.png)

**Figure 1:** These figures show that the start time for tourists vs New Yorkers varies differently on the weekdays. The greatest difference between the two groups (~20%) happens right before 10am, which makes sense because it aligns with the morning commute. Likewise, there is another peak around the evening commute (~17 hours). This relationship is minimized during the weekend, as symbolized by the line of difference. 

      
## Assignment 2: Young vs. Old
This tests my original hypothesis from W4 that younger citiBike users ride farther than their older counterparts.
