# Goodness of Fit Tests

## Assignment 1: Ascombe's Quartet & LR Ratio Tests
This was an extension of Lab 9 in which we used Ascombe's Quartet for linear models. I then compare the goodness of fit between each pair of nested models using LR Ratio Testing, both from the built in function and by scratch

## Assignment 2: Local Law 84 Energy testing
This was an applied project using linear regression techniques on Local Law 84 data. It included the following
* Using log scaling to plot our exogenous and endogenous variables (in order to limit the impact of outliers)
* Using regression models to determine which should be our exogenous vs endogenous variable
* Defining and calculating errors for Poisson statistics
* Calculating our chi-square statistic by hand, including errors
* Running LR test to see which is better, quadratic model vs simple linear model.
