# Null Hypothesis Testing and CLT
The following exercises were done in the 4th week of Principles of Urban Informatics

### Assignment 1: Central Limit Theorem (CLT): 
This exercise visualizes the CLT by examining how it applies to different distribution types (i.e. normal, binomial, poisson, chi squared, and uniform)
### Assignment 2: Citi Bike Hypothesis Testing:
This exercise tests the hypothesis that younger citi bike riders ride farther distances than their older counterparts
### Assignment 3: Bus Route Improvement (Null Hypothesis Testing)
This tests whether or not a new bus route improves commute times
